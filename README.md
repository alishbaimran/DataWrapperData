## Flying Etiquette: How Often Can You Get Up?

I picked this question because it’s something almost everyone who's flown has experienced: being stuck in the middle or window seat and needing to get up, whether it’s to use the bathroom, stretch, or grab something from the overhead bin. It can feel awkward asking the aisle person to move, especially multiple times. It’s one of those unspoken social rules on planes, and I was curious to see where most people draw the line. 

The chart shows that most people (296) think getting up **three times** during a 6-hour flight is fine, with **two times** coming in close behind (277). Only 13 people said it’s not okay to get up at all, which tells me that most people are understanding as long as you're not overdoing it.
